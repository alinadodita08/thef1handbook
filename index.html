                        <h3>MAX VERSTAPPEN IS A TWO TIME WORLD CHAMPION</h3>
                            <p>October 9th, the Japan Grand Prix took place in Suzuka.
                                There was a red flag as Carlos Sainz crashed in the first lap &
                                the weather was too extreme. The race resumed and Max kept his lead for the 
                                whole race. Charles in P2 and Checo had some nice battles until the final chicane
                                and Leclerc cut a chicane and gained an advantage. Most of you know, this results
                                in a penalty. After the chequered flag Charles was rewarded a 5 second time penalty.
                                Checo got P2 and Charles got P3. This resulted in Max's championship victory.
                                Sebastian Vettel was joyous as he recieved the DOTD award at his last race at his 
                                favourite track. More good news as Latifi got his first ever F1 points!
