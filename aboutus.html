    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The F1 Handbook was in the works since mid September of 2022. I (Alina Dodita) went 
        through many working days to complete this, I coded this as I want to spread my passion of F1 
        to others, and there's alot to the sport, and for me I didn't have anywhere to start learning, so I wanted
        to save people from the trouble.

    <h1>Meet me!</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name's Alina, I'm 14 years old and am situated in Ireland.
        My coding journey began in April 2021. I was always fascinated by coding but 
        only began pursueing it then, as I found a great company called Kodland. Kodland is an online
        coding school that teach many languages.
